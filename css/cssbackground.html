Lake Kivu, nestled between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, is a geological anomaly that holds 300 cubic kilometres of dissolved carbon dioxide and 60 cubic kilometres of methane.

The lake has the potential to explosively release these gases, which could fill the surrounding valley, potentially killing millions of people.

Researchers are trying to establish the likelihood of such an event happening, and the best way to safely siphon the gases from the lake.

This is an audio version of our feature: How dangerous is Africa’s explosive Lake Kivu?
